This repository is about achieving a simple neural network on GAP8 platform.

## Steps to implement it

- Copy file "helloworld.c" "NN_Functions.h" to your folder of helloworld in GAP8. It should be in the form of "\gap_riscv_toolchain_ubuntu\gap_sdk\examples\gap8\basic\helloworld\\\".
- Yes, the "helloworld.c" file should be replaced.
- Run it as you simulate the operating system before.
